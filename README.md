# Some AutoHotKey Scripts for OBS->Zoom

The scripts in this repo are to make using OBS->Zoom for meetings
and teaching as seamless as possible.

The general principles are:

1. Use the OBS preview projector in my secondary monitor as a shared screen for Zoom. This gives the best resolution, far better than a virtual camera.
2. Keep whatever window I want to share at 16:9 aspect ratio in my main monitor
3. Keep OBS itself on a separate virtual display, so all my attention is on
the apps I'm actually using, and none on OBS or Zoom.
